We've implemented a simple 2D mesh topology for the routers, which scales well from 4x4 to 8x8.\n\nBoth AXI and CHI have been used for their specialized purposes, and to test the entire setup, we have some Python scripts."},{"idx":4,"label":"5","overlay":0,"note":"Now, starting off at the most basic point, our Packet."},{"idx":5,"label":"6","overlay":0,"note":"Our information packets are decomposed into 256 bit FLITs, or Flow Control Unit. Each 256 bit gets a 48 bit header, with a 208 bit body.\n\nSince some packets may be very large, they can be split across many FLITs. Communication may be done with SINGLE (2'b11 TYPE) or MULTIPLE with headers, bodies and tails.\n\nThe 48 bit header only appears on the first FLIT, while the 32 bit CRC is only there on the final one. In SINGLE type FLITs, both the header and the CRC exist on the same FLIT.\n\nThe destination and source parameters provide the destination and source of the particular flit, allowing for routing at every node, and the Quality of Service part ensures that packets can be prioritized by our arbitrer."}]}
